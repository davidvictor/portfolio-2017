				description="Amptube is a discovery tool that allows up and coming creators the opportunity to earn featured placement on an established creatorâ€™s page by sharing videos with their social networks."
				contribution="Building Amptube made me the engineer I am today. It was during this effort that my skills behind the keyboard became equal to those behind the mouse. As a cofounder, I was instrumental in everything from business strategy to product development to the fundraising effort. The path from a designer to and engineer is long and fought with seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Overcoming them seems impossible until it isn't. This experience has made me not only a better designer, but a better person. Combining design thinking with an engineers skepticism is as solid of a problem solving paradigm as I've ever seen. Blast off."
